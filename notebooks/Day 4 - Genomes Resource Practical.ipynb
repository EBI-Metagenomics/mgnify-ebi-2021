    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "In this exercise, we will learn how to use the [Genomes resource within MGnify](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/browse#genomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discover the available data on the MGnify website\n",
    "- Use two search mechanisms (search by _gene_ and search by _genome_)\n",
    "- Learn how to use the MGnify API to fetch data using scripts or analysis notebooks\n",
    "- Use the _genome_ search mechanism via the API, to compare your own MAGs against a MGnify catalogue and see whether they are novel\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this works\n",
    "This file is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). \n",
    "It has instructions, and also code cells. The code cells are connected to Python, and you can run all of the code in a cell by pressing Play (▶) icon in the top bar, or pressing `shift + return`.\n",
    "The code libraries you should need are already installed."

    "An [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API \"Application programming interface\") is how your scripts (e.g. Python or R) can talk to the MGnify database.\n",

    "The MGnify API uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON \"Javascript Object Notation\") to transfer data in a systematic way. This is human-readable and computer-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular format we use is a standard called [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org). \n",
    "There is a Python package ([`jsonapi_client`](https://pypi.org/project/jsonapi-client/)) to make consuming this data easy. We're using it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MGnify API has a \"browsable interface\", which is a human-friendly way of exploring the API. The URLs for the browsable API are exactly the same as you'd use in a script or code; but when you open those URLs in a browser you see a nice interface. Find it here: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The MGnify API is \"paginated\", i.e. when you list some data you are given it in multiple pages. This is because there can sometimes by thousands of results. Thankfully `jsonapi_client` handles this for us."
