In the presentation we will cover:

- Recap of :ref:`mag:MAG Generation`

- Annotations available for catalogues and genomes
- Metadata available for catalogues and genomes
- Download files available for catalogues and genomes, via web, FTP, and the API

MAG Catalogues hands-on exercises
#################################

These exercises will use MGnify's `API <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API>`_ ("Application programming interface"),
showing how your scripts (e.g. Python or R) can talk to the MGnify database.

In partcicular, we'll be using the API Endpoints (features) associated with viewing and searching MAG Catalogues.

The practical will use a Jupyter Notebook.

Do you have MAGs?
-----------------

|info| For the last few exercises, you need some MAGs.
If you didnâ€™t get as far as making your own MAGs in the :ref:`mag:MAG Generation` exercises,
you can copy some we made earlier with this command in a Terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    cp -r /media/penelopeprime/Metagenomics-Feb22/Day3/example-mag-bins/* ~/mags

If you DID make your own, copy them to :code:`~/mags`.

.. include:: partials/jupyter.rst

Today's Notebook is "Day 3".
