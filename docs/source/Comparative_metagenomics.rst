Comparative metagenomics 
*************************

In this practical session we will make use of an actual analytical pipeline using publicly-available data from MGnify. The excercises are organized in 4 main sections:

- Fetching data and preprocessing (MGnifyR)
- Normalization, alpha diversity indices and taxonomic profiles visualization (phyloseq)
- Comparative metagenomics at community-level: Beta diversity (vegan)
- Detection of differentially abundant taxa (SIAMCAT)


Comparative metagenomics hands-on exercises

The practice has been prepared in a Jupyter Notebook.

|info| The notebook has colored boxes to indicate relevant steps in the analysis or to introduce material for discussion.

Yellow boxes :
	Up to you: To re-run the analysis changing parametra
	Questions: For open discussion

Blue boxes:
	Notes: Informative boxes about the running command
	Tips: Information useful for results interpretation


Today's Notebook is "Day 5".
